##INPUT
# Source:
The raw dataset for analysis was obtained from the following URL: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

#Data Information:

Thirty volunteers performed six activities with a smartphone. Their movements and different variables related to those movemets were recorded in the dataset.

## DATA TRANSFORMATION:

1. The estimated mean and standard deviations were extracted from the original dataset

2. A single dataset was generated by merging the training and the testing datasets using the subject IDs and activities of the volunteers

3. The activity descriptions were added to the columns

4. A new idependent dataset (tidy.txt) was generated, which contains the average for each individual for each dataset 

#Variables:
* subject: Integer identifier of the subject, there are 30 subjects
* activities_labels: Activites of the subjects 
    + 1 Walking
    + 2 Walking Upstairs
    + 3 Walking Downstairs
    + 4 Sitting
    + 5 Standing
    + 6 Laying
* features:The different types of features for the movemets that were recorded in the X, Y and Z directions.
* test: Combiend x, y, and subject data for test datasets
* train: Combined x, y, and subject data for train datasets
* MergeData: Combined test and merge datasets, showing mean and standard deviations for each feature.
* melted_MergeData: Dataset includes the integer subject identifier, description of activity, the variable and the mean for that variable. 
* mean_MergeData: Dataset includes the integer subject identifier, description of activity, and multiple columns with averages of the mean for a given feature.

## OUTPUT
The output is a new file called tidy.txt. It consists of the following elements:

* subject: Integer identifier of the subject
* activity: Type of activity of that individual: Walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying.
