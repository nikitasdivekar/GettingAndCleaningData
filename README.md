# Getting And Cleaning Data Assingment
Coursera Course

run_analysis.R does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Used descriptive variable names to label the data.
5. Generated a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

tidy.txt is the new generated file with average of each variable for each activity and each subject

CodeBook.md describes the data input link, how the code was processed, defines the variables in the run_analysis.R file, as well as the variables in the output file (tidy.txt)
